Imagination Technologies Parallel Out Controller

Required properties:

  - compatible : Compatible list, must contain "img,parallel-out".

  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device.

  - interrupts : Contains the parallel out interrupt

  - dmas : Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.

  - dma-names : Includes "tx".

  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names.

  - clock-names : Includes the following entries:
	"sys"	The system clock
	"ref"	The reference clock

Optional Properties:

  - resets: Should contain a phandle to the parallel out reset signal, if any

  - reset-names: Should contain the reset signal name "rst", if a
	reset phandle is given

Example:

parallel_out: parallel-out@18100C00 {
	compatible = "img,parallel-out";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x18100C00 0x100>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 19 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	dmas = <&mdc 16 0xffffffff 0>;
	dma-names = "tx";
	clocks = <&system_clk>, <&clk_audio>;
	clock-names = "sys", "ref";
};
