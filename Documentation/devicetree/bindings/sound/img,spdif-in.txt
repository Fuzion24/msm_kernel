  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

  - interrupts : Contains the spdif in interrupt

  - dmas : Generic dma devicetree binding as described in

	reset phandle is given

Example:

spdif_in: spdif-in@18100E00 {
	compatible = "img,spdif-in";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x18100E00 0x100>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	dmas = <&mdc 15 0xffffffff 0>;
	dma-names = "rx";
	clocks = <&system_clk>;
	clock-names = "sys";
};
